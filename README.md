# AWS-Hackathon
This project focuses on analyzing household IoT data to understand patterns and trends in energy consumption. Using the UCI Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset, which records real household data such as indoor temperature, humidity, and energy meter readings, the project visualizes how energy usage changes throughout the day and across different conditions.

The goal is to extract insights from real household energy data, visualize consumption patterns, and identify factors that contribute to high energy demand. The analysis is entirely implemented in Python, making use of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data handling, computation, and visualization.
