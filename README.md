# AWS-Hackathon
This project analyzes real-world IoT data collected from environmental sensors to understand how weather conditions affect energy consumption. Using the UCI Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset, the system processes temperature, humidity, and energy readings to visualize consumption trends and identify patterns in energy usage.

The analysis is performed entirely in Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The project demonstrates how IoT-driven data can be used to generate insights that help optimize resource utilization and support smarter agricultural and household energy management.
